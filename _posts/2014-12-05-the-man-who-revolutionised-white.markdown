The man who revolutionised white, The Milkman of India, Father of The White Revolution these are the names he is known by. Not many people know him, but we do know his product - Dr. Verghese Kurien, THE FACE BEHIND AMUL...

"Eight hours for dairy, eight hours for family and eight hours for sleep" These very famous words of Dr. Verghese Kurien teach a person that everyone in this world has 24 hours to live each day. We have loads of work to do. We have tons of plans to accomplish. Yet we have limited time. So why not use it effectively, why not divide the time such that we can cherish each and every moment that we are presented with.
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: Time management. Time when used efficiently gives the proper results.

Dr. Verghese Kurien came to KDCMPUL dairy in Anand, which was changed to AMULYA and then AMUL, on 13th May 1949, with the aim to obtain a release of his bond ASAP. At the end of 1949, when he was all set to leave Anand for MUMBAI, he was held back by Shri Tribhuvandas Patel, the then chairman of KDCMPUL.At first he thought he was just helping a friend, but later things changed and he couldn't go back, he simply didn't want to leave the place. 
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: Patience and Luck can help one do wonders in life.

He worked for the sake of farmers, for their benefit and ease.
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: "Karm karte jao fal ki chinta mat karo"

His work has received tremendous national and international recognition. The Govt. of India conferred on him the ΓÇ£Padma VibhushanΓÇ¥, the highest honour in the land next only to Bharat Ratna. He is the recipient of the World Food Price, the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership, the Carnegie ΓÇô Wateler World Peace Prize and the International Person of the Year from the U.S. apart from innumerable awards and recognition from across the world. 
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: "Kabil bano kabil, kamyaabi to jhak maar ke peeche bhagegi"

He very brilliantly quoted,"To be quite honest, service to our nation's farmers was not the career I had envisioned for myself. But somehow, a series of events swept me along and put me in a certain place at a certain time when I had to choose between one option and another."
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: There are times when you have to choose between two very important things in life. Your future depends on what you choose to do at that moment. There will be certain moments like whether I should sleep or work, whether this Idea will work or not. The decision lies in your hands, and so does the future.

He also once said, "I am in the business of empowerment. Milk is just a tool in that."
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: Believe in youself and your Idea. No matter what people think or say. JUST BELIEVE...

He said, "The milk of India is produced by millions of small and marginal farmers and landless labourers. It is on their behalf and in their name that I accept this high honour."
STARTUPS SHOULD LEARN: If you work for the benefit of others, they will respect you, and no one can snatch that honour from you.
