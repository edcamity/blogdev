E-Cell conducted its second workshop on Tuesday, 30th September 2014 at 3.30 pm under the guidance of E-Mentors in Amity School Of Engineering and Technology, Amity University. Our honourable professor Mrs. Neelam Saxena , Professor of Entrepreneurship taught students about how to generate a business model . She described that a business plan is a formal written statement which includes business goals . It is basically documented to get financial investment into the project hence it involves proper explanation of the expenses and the revenue. It may also contain background information about the organization or the team attempting to reach those goals. whereas a business model is a graph of the business plan. It is considered as a DNA of the business plan generator. It includes the intended customer base, products and details of financing. 
The following questions were answered in the workshop : 
Who is going to buy my product? 
Why he will buy only my product?(mention the speciality of your product) 
What will be the cost ? 
How will I be able to produce it? 
A more clear view to the business plan can be seen by differentiating between the Internal forces and the External forces. The Internal forces include the question Why this ? and about the people or the crowd who will buy our product and their alignment towards the product. The internal forces are those which can be measured in the real time hence they can be controlled whereas the External forces include future scenarios, market dynamics and the ecosystem. The external forces cannot be measured in the real time as one can see the changes with the time in the market and in the ecosystem. 
She told that a business model should be able to answer these questions: Who do you help? (Describe about the customer ) 
How do you interact? (Customer relationships) 
What do you do? (Value prepositions) 
How do you do it? (Key activities) 
How much will you make? (Revenue stream ) 
How do you reach them? (Distribution channels) 
What do you need? (Key resources) 
Who will help you? ( Key partners) 
What will it cost? (The cost structure) 
These questions draft a business model and so they are the constraints of a business model. 
The workshop was a success and students learned a lot about business planning and generating business models. We are looking forward to conduct more workshops with Mrs. Neelam Saxena.
