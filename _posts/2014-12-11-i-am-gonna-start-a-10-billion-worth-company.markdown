This should not be the attitude of a entrepreneur. You cannot just decide one day to open a company that will worth a lot. Money is not the focus, the focus should be on the functionality, the purpose your service/product should deliver and who should it deliver to.
You gotta have a problem that you want to solve, a wrong you want to right and you gotta be passionate about it. The ΓÇÿideaΓÇÖ is the main thing, the core thing. Everything starts with an idea and everything else comes after. Maybe you donΓÇÖt have an idea right now but that doesnΓÇÖt mean you canΓÇÖt have one. An idea can be based on virtually anything but its gotta be practical. 

Sometimes we have an idea but may already be implemented or is in process of being implemented but that may not be all you want or that efficient. We canΓÇÖt look at the competition as weΓÇÖre gonna do it better, we have to look at the competition as weΓÇÖre gonna do it differently.
