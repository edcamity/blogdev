"Agar kisi 10th grade k student se poocha jae k vo aage jaakar kya Karna ya banna chahta h, to aapke hisaab se kis answer par maar padegi? Job ya business?"

That question asked by him, was an answer for most of the questions for me. "You see this is human nature", he continued, "People have developed a strong mentality that the person doing a job, earning a certain amount of salary, working under someone else, is more educated than a person who does business. When I was in tenth grade, I had to make a.choice between science - both medical and non medical, and humanities. Because these were the two streams that my school provided at that time. Changing the school was no option and I was certainly not in a mood to go for humanities. So, forcefully, I had to choose non medical. But deep under I had a regret that I couldn't go for those subjects that would enhance my business skills. I seriously wanted to do something on my own. I wanted to be my own boss. But I couldn't go against my parents' wish or say order."

"So, I decided to do what they wanted. They were certainly having great expectations from me. After all I scored a great percentage of 89% in tenth grade. I had a brief plan about what I had to do in the next few years. I opted for science, scored 98% in board exams, the highest in my district, prepared for IIT, got admission into IIT, graduated from the most prestigious college, went to IIM and won my parents' hearts." "Then what happened?", I asked. 
He answered, "I was offered jobs from 5 top leading companies."

"Which one did you choose?"

"None. I rejected all of them. Yes that was the part of the plan. Because from the very beginning, I wanted to be my own boss. I never wanted anyone to control my life. I wanted to be free and I am free. And today my parents are proud of me."

This was the story of a man who rejected 5 top jobs, in order to pursue his dream of becoming an entrepreneur,  yet kept his parents happy..
