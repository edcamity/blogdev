When I met her, I barely knew anything about her. But when she started talking, I realised how a single minute can change people's lives. She is the owner of a recently started company named ULTRA. 'Startup' is what we call such companies. The company is basically a mobile covers' company. The belief of the owner of the company, Ms. Luthra, is to bring a revolution in the world of mobile covers.
The aim or the work of the company is to produce ultra soft, ultra smooth, ultra flexible and ultra stunning mobile covers that would make people go bananas over it. These mobile covers would allow or help the person flaunt her/his dabba phone in front of others. In short, the company aims at increasing the style quotient of all the mobile phone owners. Moreover, the mobile covers currently have a glow in the dark feature!!! Can you imagine! She is planning to add more technical features to it, which I certainly can't reveal.
When we met, we probably talked for a minute or two. Actually she talked. Her pitch was fabulously awesome. After all, she needed investors for ULTRA and I needed a product to invest in. After listening to her, her product, I couldn't think of a single reason of not to invest in it. What surprised and impressed me the most was her belief, her confidence on such a small idea, such a small product. 
After such a long time, someone impressed me in a such a small time - 1 minute!, what do you expect the time limit to be, when you are standing in a moving lift.
It is true that it takes just a minute to change one's life. This weekend, a single minute changed two lives - her's - a budding entrepreneur, and mine - a ruthless, monotonous and a stubborn investor.
