We get the ΓÇ£business viabilityΓÇ¥ question fairly often around here. People want to know if their business idea, as an idea, will work. Fair enough.

There are a lot of variables in that equation. It depends on a lot of factors. And there are no guarantees.

There are few points on which I would like to throw some light-

1. Viability depends on the problem you are solving

	This is the most important factor when it comes to viability.If you know the problem you are solving and you know the masses who will be benefited, then you can surely expect something good by your idea.

2. Viability depends on the number of people who actually want to buy the thing youΓÇÖre selling.

 If youΓÇÖre selling a very nice thing, and there arenΓÇÖt a lot of people who would buy it, it simply doesn't mean ΓÇ£That business isnΓÇÖt viableΓÇ¥.

 It can be completely viable if the number of people who want it are enough to satisfy your objectives. So if youΓÇÖre selling something and you need to make Rs. 10 lakh a year, youΓÇÖre in a much better position than someone who needs to make a crore per year. All you really need is the right amount of people.

 As long as enough people are willing to buy the product from you, your business has the potential to be viable. The more you can decrease that number, the more viable your business can become.It all depends on the boundaries you have set up.


3. Viability depends on your willingness to sell. ACTIVELY.

 This is one that kills a lot of businesses that could otherwise be successful.

 In the dating world, the number of dates you get is directly proportional to the number of people you ask.


4.  Viability depends on how much YOU want to put into it.

	People get moralistic about this and I simply donΓÇÖt like that.  ThereΓÇÖs an attitude. ΓÇ£If you REALLY wanted it youΓÇÖd work as hard as it takes.ΓÇ¥


 (Perhaps itΓÇÖs a good idea to look around at life outside your business once in a while.)



5. Viability depends on your resources and creativity.

 In general, if you have enough creativity you can find a way to sell anything. 

I promise you, no matter how weird or nice your thing is, there  are people out there selling far weirder things than you, and still making money hand over fist. That money didnΓÇÖt come easily, though. There was a lot of hustle involved and a lot of resources used.

People tend to have about ten times the resources and creativity they credit themselves for. When theyΓÇÖre willing to challenge themselves to tap into it, we tend to see a lot of good things happen.
