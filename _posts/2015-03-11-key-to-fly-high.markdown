Unable to get out of something? Control your mind. Not able to stop the distractions from controlling you? Control your mind and you will fly high. We hear this statement quite often. And sometimes we do follow this very much obediently. Do we? 

Personally speaking, I cannot. Don't know about others but many of us cannot. We cannot because we are so used to those changes that we don't want to. We cannot because we are not devoting our full concentration to our work. For example, while studying, my mind often deviates to the surroundings. I would hum a song. I would think about my day, I would feel sad about anything wrong that I did or that happened. I would think of someone else, someone whom I admire, idolise or like. I would even stare at the wall. I would do every vella act and act dumb. But I won't study. Here, my mind is controlling me. 

Another example where the mind controls the thought process. Suppose I like someone. I would think about him every moment being very much aware of the fact that this is just a mere infatuation and nothing else. I would waste my time and probably do some silly things. 

Now, is it really impossible to control the mind? Is it really impossible to stop the distractions from controlling your thoughts and your day to day activities? No it is not.

Solution to example #1. In the year 2013, when I was giving my board exams, I knew that this is the most important phase of my life and the results of this will decide in which college I'll be going. Distractions were many. Just ask a 12th grade student and you will get a complete list of the distractions that student has to face on a day to day basis. Staring at the wall, honking of the cars, voices of the animals, chirping of the birds, banging of some furniture and what not. Even the air moving from one place to another is a distraction for them. But kicking them off was the only solution. It was probably due to the concentration, the hard work and the ability to think about the good and the bad that I was able to study well. 

Solution to example #2. This problem occurs with every teenager. We feel that this is the only part of our lives. And we want to be with that person forever. But at this time, our top most priority must be study. Getting a job, making our career, making our parents proud - after all they have done so much for us, getting good grades must be our topmost priority. One just can't let her/his future suffer just because of someone else. 
Everyone here is well aware of the fact that this is a distraction and there's a need to stop ourselves from being attracted towards it. No matter what it takes. It definitely takes time, lots of time. But if one knows that this is harmful for one's life, one will surely cross this hurdle as well. 

The whole idea of telling you all these examples and the possible solutions to them was just to tell you that distractions occur in the life of each and every person. Be it Lata Mangeshkar, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Sachin Tendulkar, Mark Zuckerberg, Kalpana Chawla, Mahatma Gandhi or even Ishani Luthra.

All of these great people knew what their aim in life was. They knew that they were on the right path. Had Steve Jobs allowed the dog outside waste even 2 minutes of his precious time, we wouldn't have seen the face of Apple, the way it is today. Had Kalpana Chawla not shooed away the grudges she might have had with someone, she would have wasted a plenty of her time. She would have probably wasted the opportunity to be the first Indian woman in space and the first Indian American astronaut. 

All these great people have had certain distractions. If I would have denoted even a single minute to that tick tock of the clock hanging on the bedroom wall behind me, I would have wasted a lot of thoughts that should have been written here in this article. 
In order to achieve something great in life, one needs to focus. All these distractions are meant to disturb you. They are here in your life for a purpose. Their sole purpose is to deviate you from your goal. You just can't allow them to do so. All you gotta do is, keep your aim clear, be focused, work hard and concentrate. All you'll see is success. 
Keep all these distractions away from your path. Do what it takes to bury them, destroy them. It is tough but not impossible. Every second counts when one is doing something, when one is trying hard to achieve something. Every bit counts. One can't just let some mere distraction to change the course of their life. 

Is it really impossible to control our mind? No its not. 

Just Believe in yourself, act wisely, remove the distractions and work hard. This is the key to fly high.┬á
