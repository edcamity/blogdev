The average number of doubts for every decision: 4
And that too when I didnt mention all.
We, for some reasons always have these doubts in our minds, latched to our brains, ready to scream out in case we make up our minds. 
The decisions I mentioned were just some simple decisions, some people may make during their normal lives. 
Just remember: 'If you wanna be a successful entrepreneur, or let's say, a successful person, you have to take decisions at every point of your life. If the decision is right, even if it is risky, there shouldn't be any place for doubts. And if you have any doubt, don't do it, because at some point or the other you know that the decision you are making is not right. Clear the doubts, stick to your RIGHT decision and you will surely succeed'.
