Survival. A fundamental in itself, survival is no longer just a TRP earning function. As anyone will tell you, its not all about staying alive. There are situations that one has to deal with, staying in unfamiliar conditions and trying to come through unscathed, out of unheralded circumstances. Much more than the proverbial "Comfort-Zone".
Now, these situations and conditions are experienced on a daily basis. Be it bullying, peer pressure into smoking, drinking or even being forced to sit in a 7-hour day of absolute boredom(which for some stupid reason, your friends weren't ready to bunk); Survival instinct has taken a whole different meaning. The travails of undergoing any of the above or even something else is no less than a bad nightmare, if in case we over look the exaggeration.

A literal translation of the old hindi quote goes something like this "The Iron is hot, hammer it!". Cue Sholay rewatch number 121. Man, does this have a story.

Now the mechanical theory tells us that when a piece of metal is hot, it can be reshaped as required. Or for our most technical readers, our friends at Wikipedia say "Molding or moulding is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix." 
So, the implication of our Sholay-quote is pretty simple. If and when your personality is in molten form, mould it into the desirable. Adaptation is said to be the forte of a survivalist organism. After all, what better way is there to survive, than to adapt?

But then, what about all those quotes of not changing yourself, and always being who you are, etc.? Logically speaking, there's plenty of evidence to support that if we mold ourselves at every hurdle we face, we will lose our true identity. And you'd be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with that.

You have found him. Here. Typing this.

Think about all your heroes in the *real* world. I am going to go back and make "real" italics now since we don't want the conversation to refer to Asgard. That line was horribly irrelevant.

So. **Real** World Heroes. Do you have some in your mind? Good. Now just think about this: Do you really believe they never changed themselves to gain advantage of a situation? That they never smiled a little too hard for a person they were mentally executing? That they never jumped into a debate, they knew they were bound to lose?

You see, the word "Change" is wrongly interpreted most of the time. Molding yourself doesn't mean you become an Atheist after just having kept Navratri fasts. Nor does it mean you stop supporting your friends just because the Supreme court gave its smartest ruling on the Section 377 case.
It means you're making use of that brain of yours to slither your way through a difficult maze. And yes, that's a Slytherin reference. Remember how Snape came out to be good? Isn't that evidence enough that molding isn't a negative act? Unless you're Voldy, sorry.

Don't be afraid of change. If you know what you're doing, and if you're certain you have a plan, You'll be fine. Trust yourself and get out of that bubble comfort zone. You'll be the same, inside. Always.
