I received a message this morning. It was a beautiful speech by Sundar Pichai - an IIT-MIT Alumnus and Global Head Google Chrome:

The cockroach theory for self development.

At a restaurant, a cockroach suddenly flew from somewhere and┬á sat on a lady.

She started screaming out of fear.

With a panic stricken face and trembling voice, she started jumping, with both her hands desperately trying to get rid of the cockroach.

Her reaction was contagious, as everyone in her group also got panicky.

The lady finally managed to push the cockroach away but... it landed on another lady in the group.

Now, it was the turn of the other lady in the group to continue the drama.

The waiter rushed forward to their rescue.

In the relay of throwing, the cockroach next fell upon the waiter.

The waiter stood firm, composed himself and observed the behavior of the cockroach on his shirt.

When he was confident enough, he grabbed it with his fingers and threw it out of the restaurant.

Sipping my coffee and watching the amusement, the antenna of my mind picked up a few thoughts and started wondering, was the cockroach
responsible for their histrionic behavior?

If so, then why was the waiter not disturbed?

He handled it near to perfection, without any chaos.

It is not the cockroach, but the inability of the ladies to handle the disturbance caused by the cockroach that disturbed the ladies.

I realized that, it is not the shouting of my father or my boss or my wife that disturbs me, but it's my inability to handle the disturbances caused by their shouting that disturbs me.

It's not the traffic jams on the road that disturbs me, but my inability to handle the disturbance caused by the traffic jam that disturbs me.

More than the problem, it's my reaction to the problem that creates chaos in my life.

Lessons learnt from the story:

I understood, I should not react in life.

I should always respond.

The women reacted, the waiter responded.

Reactions are always instinctive whereas responses are always well thought of.
A beautiful way to understand............LIFE. Person who is HAPPY is not because Everything is RIGHT in his Life...He is HAPPY because his Attitude towards Everything in his Life is Right..!!

The story inspired me to write. We all search for solutions or methods, which can help us lead a life where success knocks on our door everyday. We are in search for them. Sometimes we shake hands with success, sometimes not. But there are times when a person being so close to success is not able to get it. That is the most disappointing moment in one's life. That is when life teaches you a lesson. That is the point when life shows you two paths - The first path asks you to step back, cry over your mistakes. The second path asks you to think in a positive manner. It asks you to learn from your mistakes and improve yourself.

The following results can be drawn from the two paths that life shows us.
If you follow the first path, you are likely to make the situation worse, you are likely to get unhappy and in some cases depressed. The worse case is to get devastated. Now if you follow the second path, you are likely to get sad in the beginning but then you would identify your weakness, work on them and in the long run, you would achieve what you wanted - success.

So, if your attitude towards life is right, if u have the capability to handle things with ease and with patience, if u respond other than react, and if you are able to understand this FUNDA of life, u will stay happy. After all, 
**HAPPINESS IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS...**
