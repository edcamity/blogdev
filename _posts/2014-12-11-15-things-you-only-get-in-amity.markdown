Amity Noida may be recently established, but with a crowd of over 35,000 you can definitely feel its own unique vibe every time you enter this campus. From the dudes to its foods, it spells out unique in kaleidoscopic ways.

####The Swashbuckling Studs :####
We all know at least one of them. They are never satisfied until every item of their clothing is completely coordinated and the clothing labels completely pop out-their Hermes belts,their Armani shades and of course their signature LV ΓÇ£Man pursesΓÇ¥ without which their outfit is incomplete. They strut their stuff and no f@%ks are given to any who snicker behind them.

####The Bimbette Princesses ####
They are the female counterparts of the swashbuckling studs. Shopping for them is a dedicated art. They strive for the first ones to start a trend but sometimes end up too enthusiastic in their efforts. Relax ladies-You are just going to a class, not attempting a modelling assignment.

####The just-out-of-bed-hostellers ####
When you wake up at 9 and have a class in 15 minutes, hygiene is a priority. Amidst a group of well-dressed Amitians, spotting a hosteller is easy. They have sleep wrinkled pyjamas and minty fresh breath(on account of having brushed just 10m minutes back) and an arsenal of deodorant wafting in the air around them

####The gym-nasty-ics ####
The gym is their Mecca-the place to which they devote all their energies and prayers. These guys are easy to spot; they can be seen gulping down 15 boiled eggs near the gym canteen(no yolks please) and ordering half a dozen paneer sandwiches. With their trunk sized arms and gym shorts, you can hardly miss these hard core gym freaks and they sure love the attention.

####The guitarists:####
No college gang is complete without their very own guitarist. And it seems everyone can strum a guitar in college. They have a wide assortment of songs in their repository and never do they mind humming up a tune or two. And singing oldies with a guitar as an accompaniment ,well its something every one should do at least once.

####The I-m-2QL-4SQL:#### 
These individuals apparently hate attending classes. Seeing them in class is an event which demands the entire classΓÇÖ attention. Attending classes is way too lame for 'em.

####The PDA couples:####
These couples are so in love that they can barely contain themselves. And if you ever spy one near the football field in the evening-just a word of caution-stay away. You donΓÇÖt want to see something which can never be unseen.

####The viral videos:####
All those who go to Amity, you know what I am talking about, donΓÇÖt you?

####The auto-wallas:####
Exit from any gate from the campus and your ears get assaulted by the cries of the auto wallas bellowingΓÇ¥ tees rupaya botanical , tees rupaya botanical; Madam ji chalogay?ΓÇ¥. They drive their vehicles in a manner straight out of Dhoom-3 and consider themselves in the Grand-Prix,racing to the metro stations in record time.

####The Parantha wallas:####
They are responsible for feeding half of the collegeΓÇÖs students by making the most delicious, buttery paranthas with momoΓÇÖs ki chutney and aam ka achaar accompanied with a shot of adrak wali chai. You can quietly sit in the broken chairs and see the traffic simply buzz by..

####The irate faculty members:####

They always are in a bad mood. They snarl,they frown and boy if they ever find you leaning against their car. As the phrase goes ΓÇ£Ab toh beta, shaamat aa gayiΓÇ¥.

####The kids ####

Who expects 4-5 year olds in an Institute for adults? Amity though provides its faculty members cr├¿che facilities. The result is a long stream of babies(Yes, for us they are babies) in their school uniforms which brings the nostalgic memories of our schooldays to our minds.

Love it here, or hate it here, there is no changing it. Amity has its own unique spirit and its own eclectic mix of students all who combine to thread a wonderful blend with its own character.
