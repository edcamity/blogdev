Feeling like a failure?
So did these entrepreneurs, before they went on to revolutionize their industries.
Entrepreneurship is  living a few years of your life like most people wonΓÇÖt, so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can't. 

SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS HAVE SOME MEASURE OF OVERCONFIDENCE.

Optimistic bias is another common trait, as successful entrepreneurs tend to look on the brighter side. They look at failure and find the valuable lesson, and bring it to the next thing.

Here are five growth-minded entrepreneurs and their stories:

**1. Jeff Walker - The Internet Entrepreneur Extraordinaire**

WeΓÇÖve all heard of the $6 million man. But what about the $400 million man? Meet Jeff WalkerΓÇô Internet Entrepreneur Extraordinaire.

Yes ΓÇö itΓÇÖs a new day when a common man barely earning enough to scrape by and feed his family can leverage the Internet into an empire responsible for $400 million in sales over a 15 year period.
Yes ΓÇö Jeff is a common man. Just like me. Just like you.
You see, he is the Founder and CEO of a company called Internet Alchemy, Inc located in a little town in Colorado. Never heard of it, right? Yes ΓÇö I hadnΓÇÖt either.
But therein lies the beauty of this story. A humble beginning: common man, in dire financial straits, turns on the Internet in his humble abode in the middle of nowhere, and starts to tinker. Starts to play around with selling investment advice via email. Has a total of 19 email addresses to start. And his own second email address and his wifeΓÇÖs are two of them.
Fifteen years later ΓÇö heΓÇÖs still a humble man; living in that small town in Colorado and driving a Ford pickup truck ΓÇö but heΓÇÖs sold $20 million of his product called Product Launch Formula which has been directly responsible for helping other business owners rake in a cool $400 million of their own cash.

Best known award-winning talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show ΓÇö the highest-rated program of its kind in history ΓÇö Oprah Winfrey is dubbed as the ΓÇÿQueen of all mediaΓÇÖ and ranked as the richest African-American of the 20th century.
She was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a teenage single mother. She was later raised in an inner-city Milwaukee neighborhood. She has often spoken about the hardships she experienced during childhood, saying she was raped at age 9 and at 13, after suffering years of abuse, she ran away from home. She became pregnant at 14. Her son, she said, died in infancy. While in high school, she landed a job in radio and began co-anchoring the local evening news at the age of 19. She got transferred to the daytime-talk-show arena because of her emotional ad-lib delivery.
She became a millionaire at age 32 when her talk show went national. She is credited with creating a more intimate confessional form of media communication. ForbesΓÇÖ international rich list has listed her as the worldΓÇÖs only black billionaire from 2004 to 2006 and as the first black woman billionaire in world history. As of 2014, she has a net worth in excess of 2.9 billion dollars and has overtaken former eBay CEO Meg Whitman as the richest self-made woman in America

**3. FAILED TRAFFIC SOFTWARE DESIGNERS: BILL GATES AND PAUL ALLEN**

Before Microsoft would change the world of software, there was Traf-O-Data. Classmates at SeattleΓÇÖs Lakeside High School, Bill Gates and Paul Allen designed a computerized microprocessor that would analyze traffic data from the black rubber traffic counters that are placed on roads, creating reports for Washington state highway departmentΓÇÖs traffic engineers. The idea was to optimize traffic and end road congestion. Lofty goal, but the pairΓÇÖs first demo for local county officials didnΓÇÖt work. And the idea would later become obsolete when the state of Washington offered to tabulate the tapes for cities for free.
But Gates and Allen didnΓÇÖt let their lessons go unlearned. They learned how to write software and in 1975, they formed a new startup called "Micro-Soft."
In 2011, Paul Allen told Newsweek: "Since then, I have made my share of business mistakes, but Traf-O-Data remains my favorite mistake because it confirmed to me that every failure contains the seeds of your next success. It bolstered my conviction that micro-processors would soon run the same programs as larger computers, but at a much lower cost."

**4. FAILED HORSERADISH SELLER: HENRY J. HEINZ**

AmericaΓÇÖs favorite ketchup makerΓÇöHenry J. HeinzΓÇöactually started out as a horseradish peddler. At the time, horseradish was a popular condiment, especially among English and German immigrant families who used it to flavor meat, potatoes, and cabbage. It was also labor intensive to make. Bottled horseradish was available, but the bottles were opaque and fillers were often used. Heinz felt customers wanted to see what they were buying, so he decided to package his offering in clear bottles. In 1869, he formed Heinz Noble & Co. with his friend L.C. Noble.
For the first five years sales were good due to the companyΓÇÖs reputation for offering high-quality products. But Heinz Noble & Co. would fall victim to the Panic of 1873. The economy was depressed and Heinz couldnΓÇÖt pay his creditors or employees. In 1875, he and his partner filed for bankruptcy.
A year later, Heinz would form H.J. Heinz Company with his brother John Heinz and cousin Frederick Heinz. One of their first products was ketchup. The company grew rapidly, adding products such as baked beans and pickles. Incorporated in 1905, Heinz served as president until he died in 1919. It seems Heinz learned from his first venture: "To do a common thing uncommonly well brings success," he was quoted as saying.
In 2013, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital acquired H.J. Heinz Company for $28 billion.

**5. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield Ben & JerryΓÇÖs**

The now-legendary duo decided to open a business after taking a correspondence course on the art of ice cream making. They discovered that just about the only college town without an ice cream shop was Burlington, Vermont. With $8,000 in savings and a $4,000 loan, they leased an old gas station in Burlington, purchased equipment, and began coming up with ideas for ΓÇ£uniqueΓÇ¥ flavors. Twenty years later, the company was taking in $237 million in annual revenue.
