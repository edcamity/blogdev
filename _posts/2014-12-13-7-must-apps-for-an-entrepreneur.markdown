The business world is a fast-moving place where you need to be on your toes all the time. The following apps will help you move as quickly as the rest of the world does. Without these apps, you might find yourself living in the past.

 Mint-

An entrepreneur probably knows a thing or two about managing finances, but it's always good to be able to easily access information about personal cash flow. Mint allows you to record expenses, create budgets and manage savings plans, all from your phone.

If you donΓÇÖt have your hands free or if you talk faster than you type, Dragon Dictation is a great app for you. You can text, email, or compose documents using the power of your voice. This is a very accurate piece of dictation software that actually understands. With Dragon Dictation, you can focus on what youΓÇÖre writing, and what youΓÇÖre doing independently of each other.

Do you sign a ton of different documents on a regular basis, and find it hard to find a printer and scanner while on the road to keep up with it? Particularly in the sales world, it can be brutal trying to keep up with the paper work, and making sure that everything that needs to be signed actually gets signed. With EchoSign, you can sign and send documents with ease right from your portable device.

As entrepreneurs, we're full of great ideas, so much so that they hit us when we least expect them. Enter Pocket, a phone-based bookmarking app which can save all types of content - anything from a lengthy article to a work report -- to all your electronic devices.

This mobile app is one of the most helpful on-the-go apps for entrepreneurs. Easily send files, documents or photos through the app to your nearest FedEx location to be printed or made into a beautiful presentation. You can even upload files directly from Box, Google Drive and DropBox.

As strange as it sounds, the fax is still an efficient method of keeping in touch with your colleagues and others in your network. When you have to send a large document, this seemingly archaic form of communication is still useful. But try using your tablet as a fax machine. With eFax, you can do precisely that from wherever you happen to be. Have faxes coming in? ItΓÇÖs covered. Need to send a fax to an office that hasnΓÇÖt gone paperless? ItΓÇÖs taken care of.

Skitch-

When you have a great idea, sometimes itΓÇÖs good to overlay it on a picture, but many times you donΓÇÖt want to damage the original or you donΓÇÖt have the original. With Skitch, you can take a picture and draw on it right on your portable device.
