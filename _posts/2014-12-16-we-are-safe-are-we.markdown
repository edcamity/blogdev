When I go out, I fear. 
When I go to a party alone or with my parents, I fear. 
When I go to the college, I fear. 
When I go for a movie, I fear.
I fear because I am afraid, of being attacked, touched, stared, raped and killed. I fear because I feel helpless, I feel hopeless. I fear because I feel alone. I fear, not because I'm weak, but because those men out there are stronger than me. I fear because of their mentality. I fear when I wear shorts or a skirt or a jeans or a saree or a burkha, because I'm afraid of them. It's not my mistake. It's their's. Still I fear that I'll be attacked any time. 

I fear because 2 years back, on the same date, a girl was brutally attacked, tortured, raped and killed. And I don't know what may happen with me the very next moment...
Yes, I am talking about the NIRBHAYA RAPE CASE. That horrifying night, that horrifying incident shocks me, irritates me, scares me. And because of this, I fear. 

We hoped. We prayed. We even went for candle marches. 2 years have passed. But I can't see even an inch of progress. Even after 2 years, women are raped and murdered. And still there's no progress. Those bastards out there, I'm sorry for my language, but those bastards out there have made our lives hell. 

We hope that the government will do something for the women. We hope that the situation will become better. But we all have seen that it just worsens. 

All the girls and the women reading this, don't you think that there should be some solution to this? Ofcourse you do. Before hoping that the laws will change, it's very important for us to know that our safety lies in our hands. 

So, today I invite each one of you to present your ideas so that there's a solution, so that the situation becomes better, so that we can live our lives without any fear.

Bring out your ideas. It may be a device, an app, anything. Think, combine your ideas and post here. Think to find a solution. Think for the betterment of the society. Most importantly, think for your and your loved one's safety...
