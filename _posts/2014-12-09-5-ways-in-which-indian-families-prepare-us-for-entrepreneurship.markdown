1. PATIENCE

Our elders teach us to be extremely patient in dealing with others. We always have a fake smile on our faces when otherΓÇÖs kids break our things and are forced to say,ΓÇ¥ Koi nii aunty bacha haiΓÇ¥ even though we are burning inside. We are fuming inside when our relatives, instead of congratulating us on bagging a job, ask us questions like ΓÇ£beta,salary kitni hai??ΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£beta, ab shaadi kab kar rahe ho??ΓÇ¥. We only know how difficult, how painful from inside the fake smile is!!!

2.	TEAM WORK

You have to share everything with each and everyone around you. It doesnΓÇÖt matter if you can tolerate her/him or not. It doesnΓÇÖt matter if the other person likes to break or lose your stuff, getting angry or upset is seriously not an option. ΓÇ£Galti koi ek kare, aur daant sabko pade. Ye kaisi nainsafi h!!!ΓÇ¥

3.	MULTI TASKING

It doesnΓÇÖt matter who you are, or who your parents are, from Ambani to chai vala, every one has to be a multitasker! One must not limit oneself to a certain domain,from being the employee of the year to the press vala bhaiya, har kisi ko har ek kaam ana chahiye, warna ΓÇ£tumse shaadi kon karega!!!ΓÇ¥
 
4.	JUGAAD

This is probably the only thing that we people, or to be more specific, we INDIANS are taught since we stepped into this world ΓÇô JUGAAD!!!  ΓÇ£JUGAAD hamare khoon mein hai!!!ΓÇ¥

5.	NETWORKING THROUGH RISHTEYDARI

Agar aapke paas hai accha dimaag, acche marks aur acchi personality, to aapko job mil sakti haiΓÇª BAKWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!! ΓÇ£Bhai rishteydaari kis din kaam aegi?ΓÇ¥ 

Interviewer: What is your CGPA?
Student: Sir ji, CGPA toooΓÇª. Theek thaak hi hai. But mere papa ke chacha ke bhatije aapki company ke project manager hai.
Interviewer: Arrey waah!! Ye hui na baat! Beta ye batao thanda loge ya garam?
