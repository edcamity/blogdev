Sorry for the heading, but I couldnΓÇÖt think of any other catchy stuff.
Well, just ignore it.

No matter what degree you have, which college you went to, finally a day comes when you have to decide the path you're going to choose for your career, *getting a job* or *becoming an entrepreneur*. (Well it's actually a long process involving a lot of researching and thinking, taking a hell lot of factors into account, but for the sake of saying it, letΓÇÖs call it a day)


On one side we have **jobs**. 
When looking for a job, the employer of a certain organization specifies certain criteria which are to be met. You go for an interview,  show the interviewer your degrees, marks, answer a few questions, chat a little. Ah, the typical stuff. If the employer doesn't find you suitable for the job, then well, bad luck. You simply start your job hunt all over again.
But if you do get the job, you sign a contract, which entitles you as an employee of the company, who will contribute his/ her expertise to any endeavours of the employer. You get a regular income, well, generally, work for a fixed 9-10 hrs, 5 days a week and, that's it! 
TaDa!
You have gained yourself the distinction of officially being a member of the HardWorkingSheepsUnited spread all over the world designed to work their arses off until they die! Yay!

Not literally, but you do get the point.

*Disclaimer: The stuff mentioned in the contract are liable to a few tweaks and changes here and there, please do not mind.*

- Your working hours are flexible.
Yay!

 You might be asked to come on a Saturday, or even on Sunday, well you never know, you aren't the boss.
 
 Nooooo :(

- Your salary might be delayed for a week, a month, or even several months.

- You might be asked to leave the organization if you aren't working upto what's asked from you.
SPOILER ALERT: You might be asked to leave even though you are working fair enough for reason( Say hello to World Economy Breakdown!).

- You might not get enough time to spend with your family, friends, or even your XBox.
Them feels.

On the other hand we have the option of becoming an **entrepreneur**.
You start everything from scratch. You yourself are responsible for all of the financial costs that come with the organization's start up. You might get into some serious long term debt because of this. You would have to meet dozens of people every now and then. Get investors for your thing. Keep worrying day and night if your plan would be a hit or not. You might work for years to make it work, but may fail eventually. You might be unable to recover from the failure, ever.

Too many risks involved?

Well, the possibility of all of the stuff mentioned above actually happening is like the likeliness of me marrying Deepika Padukone or something.
But I had to mention all that as they highlight some of the major misconceptions people have in their minds when even thinking about starting something new.

It's about time we talk about this.

There are many things which are to be taken care of when aiming to become an entrepreneur, but if this is all you see, you are not looking at the bigger picture, which is waaay bigger.

- You are self-employed.
YOU are the BOSS.
YES YOU.

 YOU get to choose the working hours, the place, what to focus upon, kinda everything.

 You are the employee too but let's keep that aside for now.

- Entrepreneurship is a car driven with a renewable, reusable and pollution-free fuel of innovation, passion and of course, hard work.
So basically, though it asks a lot from you, you end up doing what YOU.LOVE.DOING.
 HAPPINESS.

- *You work 24x7*
.
WHAT
HOW'S THAT A GOOD THING?

 Well, not literally. But an entrepreneur's job never ends at 5:00 PM. Other than working in your office or something, you are also working in your head, striving to improve your organization as much as you can.
Thinking of unique yet feasible ways in which you can bring about positive changes for your company.
Thus keeping your mind bus yet refreshing with ideas every now and then( Trust me it's a good thing).

- *Learning never ends*.

 Back to school eh?
But yeah.
You get to meet A LOT of people, get to share a lot of stuff, professional as well as personal.
You meet people coming from different walks of life, who had once struggled a lot, even failed at once, but are now going smooth with their work, leaving many people like you dazzled, awe struck with their devotion to their passion, inspiring you to do the same in turn.

- *You would be helping a lot of people.*
It's your company remember?
So obviously you'd be generating jobs, helping those talented yet unemployed people in the country.
You'd be making products, or generating services which would be making the lives of various customers a hell lotta comfortable and easier.

- *You'd keep on getting help from a variety of sources.*

 *Agar kisi cheez ko badi shiddat se chaho
toh poori kaynat tumhe usse milane ki sajish karti hai*
-~~Shahrukh Khan~~

 *Kartikey Singh*.
 , quoted as saying this way before Om Shanti Om came out
 
 Need I say more?
 
Long story short.
No matter which path you finally take, make sure it's the one in which you may not only be successful, but also enjoy doing the work concerning it. It should be the one impacting each and every aspect of your life, in a positive way. After all, it's something on which everything else in your life would be dependent, directly or indirectly.

Choose wisely.
Your life. Check.
Your rules or not. It depends.
