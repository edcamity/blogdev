What's Coworking? 

Coworking is a new way to work.  It is also a very old way. History shows us again and again that when human beings with diverse talents gather and practice their talents in a place that serves as a melting pot of ideas, there is a greatly increased chance that the intersection of those ideas, expertise and resources will create delight, fulfilment, and the sort of creative energy that produces a quality of innovation that you can never accomplish alone or as a cog within an organized entity.

That is the old (yet relevant!) part of coworking.  But there is much that is new about the term. The 21st Century's economy is shaped by two great movements: technology and globalization.  Around the world, these movements are changing the workplace in dramatic and surprising ways. In exponentially growing numbers, workers are being released from the geographical confines of the traditional workplace. Today, we have greater ability to create the means for this co-mingling of ideas than ever before, and to achieve things by working together in new, intelligent ways.  We seek to harness the latent power of the innovation-driving and economy-driving forces by establishing a place, a beacon, where people can interact, in person, and virtually, in the spirit of bringing together what we know in order to achieve something greater.

We should promote Co-Working technique which is the characteristic way of work. It involves shared working environment, be it an office, independent activity, start-ups, freelancers or entrepreneurs. The idea is simple: independent professionals and those with workplace flexibility work better together than they do alone. Coworking spaces are about community-building and sustainability. Participants agree to uphold the values set forth by the movementΓÇÖs founders, as well as interact and share with one another. It should be about creating better places to work and as a result, a better way to work.

We should be focused at building a community that spreads across our co-working locations and collaborates over our online platform. The members of this Community should be working on a model and approach that we call Open Coworking. They might be working in many different sectors of the economy and their businesses all look very different. Still, all are being a part of one big community.
