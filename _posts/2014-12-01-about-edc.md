ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm optimistic but IΓÇÖm an entrepreneurΓÇªΓÇ¥ - Mark Zuckerberg

Do you have an idea? Do you aspire to start your own business? Do you love to be your own boss? If the answer to any one of these questions is yes, then hurray! You have what it takes to become an entrepreneur. eDC is one such place where one can pursue his/her dream of becoming an entrepreneur. We at eDC inspire, get inspired, motivate people and get motivated in order to become an entrepreneur. The ideas of the thirteenth search engine without all the features of a web portal; the tenth social network, and limited only to college students with no money. These all sounded really bad but they turned out to be good. If they sounded really good, there would be too many people working on them. 
At eDC, we answer questions like why and how. eDC is a bunch of fun filled activities which in no time bring out the best in us. Risk taking is our first motive. As Mark Zuckerberg says, ΓÇ£Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.ΓÇ¥

The best part of entrepreneurship is that there are no age limits. Young and old, both can become entrepreneurs. The right path to success is provided here, at eDC. DonΓÇÖt let your idea rotten over years. Come out; bring your idea to the world. Get the feedback of people about your product. Most importantly, BE A JOB CREATOR, NOT A JOB SEEKER.
