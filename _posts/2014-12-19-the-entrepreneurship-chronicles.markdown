The Entrepreneurship Chronicles

(This is an elaborate dissection of a group discussion, which has been thoroughly edited exclusively for this blog...)


"Can we now talk about something else other than Steve Jobs...?"

All thirty-seven pairs of eyes stared at me and an awkward silence prevailed in the room for some 3.459 seconds, after which the group discussion continued. 

The group discussion was on entrepreneurship, and was being organized by the Entrepreneurship-Cell (E-cell) of our college, which I was part of...and was therefore, doing all sorts of odd jobs like kidnapping participants from neighbouring classes and making them part of the audience, and becoming the moderator for 5 seconds (out of which the details of 3.459 seconds have already been explained). 

The GD flagged off with the enthusiastic participants explaining the differences between the two types of professions with everyone unanimously agreeing that entrepreneurs generate employment, and all people with jobs generally work under an entrepreneur.The next part of the debate went on with people taking sides. A few,however, still remained unsure of both and remained neutral (or maybe were feeling shy to speak, or probably had no idea why they were present there in the first place)... 

The pros and cons of both working in a job and entrepreneurship were discussed. While some maintained that jobs provided security and a steady income according to the skill, others argued pointing out that no job could be termed as secure in these troubled times.When the future entrepreneurs said that entrepreneurship generates jobs and contributes to the economy, the opponents were quick in hitting out at them by saying that not everyone has the required resources to start a business venture and then went on to describe further other limitations faced in case of entrepreneurship like requirements of capital, space and the monopoly in the market, among others. 
(One not-so-gentleman got seriously carried away and got so senti that he almost hit the person sitting in front of him; he had already covered half of the table's surface area!)

The discussion then took a turn to describe the emotional aspects of both. For example, people in favour of jobs argued that entrepreneurs don't have enough time to spend with their families. The opposition laughed off the question and put it back asking how much free time is then assured by a job. A guy even went on to say, "In ancient times, people who used to give up everything- their family, friends,etc. were called "sanyasis"...today they are known as "employees".

A┬áfew┬áexamples┬áof┬ásuccessful┬áentrepreneurs┬áwere┬ádiscussed┬áin┬ádetail.┬áSteve┬áJobs┬áturned┬áout┬áto┬ábe┬áthe┬ámost┬ádiscussed┬ápersonality.┬áThe┬áparticipants┬áeven┬áwent┬áon┬áto┬ádiscuss┬áhis┬álife┬áin┬ádetail┬ádrawing┬áinspiration.┬áBoth┬ágroups┬áagreed┬áthat┬áhe┬áwas┬áa┬ágreat┬áleader┬áwho┬áis┬áthe┬ábest┬áexample┬áof┬áan┬áentrepreneur┬áas┬áhe┬áfaced┬áinnumerable┬áchallenges┬ábut┬ánever┬ábuckled┬áunder┬áthe┬ápressure.┬á(It was here when I intervened...)
┬á
However,┬áthe┬ápeople┬áopposing┬áentrepreneurship┬ámade┬áa┬ápoint┬áthat┬ásuch┬ápeople┬áare┬ávery┬árare-┬áprobably┬áone┬áin┬áa┬ámillion,┬áand┬áthus┬ánot┬áeveryone┬ácould┬ábecome┬áa┬ásuccessful┬áentrepreneur. (I personally wanted to explicitly oppose this but I contained myself with a lot of difficulty.)

The discussion thus went on continuously for a good one hour, forty two minutes and fifty eight seconds. Both the sides presented their respective viewpoints which were analysed in detail by the moderators.

In the end, as the chief moderators summed up the debate, there was something that kept on haunting my mind-

God knows what would have happened if someone had not stopped the not-so-gentleman, who was sprawled on the table and half a millimetre away from grabbing the collar of the guy opposite to him.
