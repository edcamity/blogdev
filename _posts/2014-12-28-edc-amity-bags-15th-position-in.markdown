Results can also bring a feeling of jubilation. This is what the students of Amity University realize when they see the final leaderboards of the National Entrpreneurship Challenge, 2014 organized by IIT Bombay. 

A sense of triumph prevailed among the members of the Entrepreneurship Development Centre at Amity University when the results came out and our college was ajudged 15th out of a total of 107 teams. The team scored 3145 points in total.

The competition spanned over four months and comprised of a number of tasks	to be completed in various domains that required a lot of brainstorming by the team who painstakingly worked for the challenge braving all odds like exams, deadlines and the like.

The team managed to successfully complete 32 tasks. It was an exhilarating experience for the students who loved every bit of their journey that will go a long way in their career as an entrepreneur.

And now, I need to sign off as it is time to party and celebrate!
