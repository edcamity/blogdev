In the 21st century, Entrepreneurship is *not about becoming your own boss*, atleast not for me or for the plethora of entrepreneurs I have talked to over the past few years, nor has it been about money. I have seen only one thing common among all of them - 

>A spark and a desire to solve problems no matter how hard so that people can live better lives. 

It has been about creating value out of garbage, challenging the status quo and more importantly turning ideas into actions. 

Poverty and unemployment necessitated entrepreneurship in the 19th and 20th century where people had to go out of their comfort zones, wandering the unchartered worlds of industrialism on their own so that they could feed their families. These entrepreneurs turned out to be the golden diamonds of humanity establishing businesses and creating products that forever changed humanity. Edison? He changed the way the world lived at night. Andrew Carnegie? He changed the way people constructed their abodes. Rockfeller? He changed the way humanity generated its energy sources. Or Tata? Creating the biggest empire in India that is still looked up to till this day!

Following them were the next generation of entrepreneurs who created services that made people livesΓÇÖ easier and more enjoyable! Bill Gates and Steve Jobs led the computer revolution while Sergey Brin and Larry Page were putting the worldΓÇÖs information at everyoneΓÇÖs finger tips. Meanwhile Jeff Bezos was busy delivering all kinds of goods to whoever wanted them. Back home, Murthy and Shiv Nadar were busy ensuring that India and its citizens are not left behind in the knowledge-service economy of the 21st century.

You see how the primary motivation for the biggest and best of all was not money? It was a desire to do something. Creating something that will last a lifetime. Being challenged.  Touching the lives of the needy.  Providing a better quality of life for yourself and those you care about (namely your fellow homo sapiens. :P )

This is what has captured my imagination and has me in awe! When you have the right idea at the right time with the right people nothing in this world is impossible. Entrepreneurship is not for everyone and certainly not for the faint-hearted. But for those who are willing to take the road not taken maybe, just maybe, a rich life experience awaits them when the journey comes to an end. 

That is why.
