eDC conducted some events. Missed it? Why fear when I'm here. I'll be posting the reports of all the 4 events conducted so far. Here's the first one...


E-Cell conducted its first event on Friday, 19th September 2014 at 3.30 pm under the guidance of E-Mentors. The event started with the introduction of all E-mentors and e-leaders. Our E-Mentor Prof. Sanjeev Thakur briefed students on the idea behind the creation of E-Cell and what kinds of activities would be covered. 
The main focus of the event was a presentation on the basics of entrepreneurship by Dr. Neelam Saxena, Professor of Entrepreneurship. Respected maΓÇÖam covered on what is entrepreneurship, who all are entrepreneurs and the necessity of entrepreneurship. She talked about realistic projects and companies and the age of entrepreneurship. Moreover she stressed on the traits and qualities necessary in an entrepreneur which include, but are not limited to, risk-taking, decision-making, vision, thinking out of the box and the need to be passionate about your work. 
The session was concluded by a group discussion by students on the traits and qualities of an entrepreneur. Students presented well-formed and concrete points on the must-have qualities inside an entrepreneur such as the ability and willingness to take risks, patience, having a vision, information and knowledge skills as well as the disciple to meet the needs of the company.
